Prep your soil ahead of planting time. Soil preparation will involve mixing compost, manure and any additional things that are needed based on the vegetable or fruit needs. Regular watering is needed either by hand or drip. Drip irrigation is most effective to effectively use resources and maximize the benefit of watering and for plants to uptake the water and less nutrient loss from the soil due to run off. Concentrate on building soil with natural stuff like manures, compost, worm castings, kitchen waste etc rather than resorting store bought fertilizers. Understand your backyard and how much sun each area gets. Plan based on sun needs of the plant. Most vegetables need 6 to 8 hours of Sunlight. Dallas Summer temperatures are harsh, so plant to cover crops with a shade cloth. Inspect your plants for any signs of pests. A healthy plant will fight back pests. Unhealthy plants attract pests. Remove dead/ yellowing foliage on regular bases. Avoid watering foliage and only water bottom of the plant. Timely pruning and keep ing the health of the plant are very crucial.
